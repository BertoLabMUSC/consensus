Java Comand

Hi Stefano,

no problem, I would be stressed, too.

I attached the two programs to that mail.
Obviously, correlation.jar starts the spearman correlation calculation.
You need two files:
    - transcription factors
    - Genes

The layout of this files has to be same as you provided me for the
BrainSpan project.
The program detects the amount of cores available on the machine and
uses all of them. Do not run this on machines with other tasks with big
files (would be mean for the others).


The output is a txt file with all genes as columns and TFs as rows. The
cells of the matrix is the spearman rho value for the row/cell pair.

This file is needed for the wto calculation (wto.jar). wto.jar expects a
path with these txt files and calculates for each of them a wto network.
The output is the wto network (gzipped) and a small summary (*.bins)
with a binned summary how the wto are distributed between -1 and 1.


How to run it from the shell:

java -jar -Xmx25G correlation.jar file_TF file_Genes


java -jar -Xmx25G wto.jar folder_containing_output_of_correlation.jar
numbers_of_you_want_to_use

The programs are pretty fast, for the amygdala data it takes around 15
minutes.


Hint: The -Xmx parameter controls how much memory the program can use.
Since the programs are using matrices don't be mean with that parameter.
Especially the wto consumes some memory because it stores the TFvsGenes,
TFvsTF and the matrix product at runtime.

The filtering should be applied between these two programs.

You can access the source code with this command:


          git clone http://git2.gurkware.de/daniel/random_wto.git

Git should be installed on any BioInf machine.
